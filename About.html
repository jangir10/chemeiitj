              <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">The Department of Chemical Engineering offers under-graduate (B.Tech.) and post-graduate (M.Tech., M.Tech.-Ph.D. and Ph.D.) programs in chemical engineering. Through the academic programs, the department is making a conscious effort to establish itself as a leading institute in the new genre of chemical engineering education. The program involves traditional courses, emerging areas and specialisations such as process engineering intelligence, molecular engineering and sustainability.

                In line with the new education policy, B.Tech. (Chemical Engineering) students will have unique opportunity and flexibility for:
                
                <br>(i) Minor in (a) Management; (b) Entrepreneurship; (c) Data Science
                
                <br>(ii) Five (5) year B.Tech.+M.Tech./ MBA
                
                <br>(iii) One (1) year Engineering Innovation opportunity
